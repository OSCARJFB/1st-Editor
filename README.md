# Editor

## This is a terminal-based text editor
The editors basic features are working, you can load and edit files, navigate the data with the arrow keys, copy and paste the content etc. 
However, there are some minor issues, despite this I think it's a cool little program =)
This project is now set as read only, I'm currently working on a new text editor https://github.com/OSCARJFB/2nd-Editor

### COMMAND LIST:

ESC + S = save 

ESC + e = exit  

ESC + y = copy 

ESC + d = Cut	

ESC + p = paste
